# What is PolarGen?

- `PolarGen` is a __Information Generating Script__, which is a one-stop tool for generating fake info such as valid credit cards, names, addresses, emails, jobs, phone numbers, etc, as well as being able to validate a credit card.
- This tool mainly uses __Faker__ python library, in order to generate the credit cards, names, etc.
- The way the credit cards are generated is by utilizing an algorithim called the Luhn algorithim, which is what all credit cards follow.  

# :heavy_exclamation_mark: DISCLAIMER: 
**Using it for the purpose of free trials, or public payments to a place/organization that is not yours is illegal, and should not be done under any circumstances.  The main reason I put it into this tool was for educational purposes, and so that people could test the security of their own websites and buisnesses.  We are not responsible for anything you choose to do with this tool, and any trouble you may get into.**
